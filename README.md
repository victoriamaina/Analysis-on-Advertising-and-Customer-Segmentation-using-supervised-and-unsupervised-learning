# Analysis on Advertising-and-Customer-Segmentation using supervised and unsupervised learning

## Predicting customer ad clicks

### Research Question

A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to create a solution that would allow her to determine whether ads targeted to audiences of certain characteristics i.e. city, male country, ad topic, etc. would click on her ads. Ceate a prediction model that more accurately predicts whether a user will click an Ad.

#### Technologies used

R programming language

tidyverse

ggcorrplot

moments package

### Metrics of success

When i identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

We will then create various classification models to predict which individuals will click on ads. We use confusion matrix and accuracy score as our metrics of success

#### Dataset
